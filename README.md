# Monte Carlo Option Pricer

A high-performance, production-ready Monte Carlo simulation engine for pricing European options, complete with comprehensive risk analysis and visualization. This project showcases a blend of advanced Python programming, financial modeling, and modern software engineering best practices.

## 🎯 Overview

The Monte Carlo Option Pricer provides a robust framework for option valuation by combining the analytical Black-Scholes model with stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. The core of the project is a high-performance simulation engine, accelerated with Numba JIT compilation, which achieves a significant speedup (over 100x) compared to pure Python implementations. This allows for large-scale simulations without sacrificing performance.

### Key Capabilities

- **Dual Pricing Models**: European Call and Put option pricing using both the analytical Black-Scholes formula and a Monte Carlo simulation engine.
- **Comprehensive Risk Metrics**: Calculation and visualization of key risk metrics, including Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and the Greeks (Delta and Vega).
- **Live Data Integration**: Seamless integration with Yahoo Finance to fetch historical price data and calculate annualized volatility for more realistic pricing.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: A suite of plotting functions to generate insightful visualizations, including simulation convergence analysis, P&L distributions, and 3D sensitivity surfaces for the Greeks.
- **Production-Ready**: The project is fully containerized with Docker, includes a comprehensive test suite with `pytest`, and features a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and code quality checks.

---

## 🏁 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` or `conda` for package management.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/quant-option-pricer.git
cd quant-option-pricer

# Install dependencies (standard)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install in editable/development mode (recommended for contributors)
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:**
> - Use `requirements.txt` for standard Python/pip environments.
> - Use `environment.yml` with `conda env create -f environment.yml` for full Conda-based environments (recommended for reproducibility or if you use Anaconda/Miniconda).

### Basic Usage

The primary entry point is `quant_option.py`, a command-line interface for pricing options.

```bash
# Price a call option for any ticker (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, TSLA)
python quant_option.py --ticker MSFT

# Price a put option for TSLA with custom parameters
python quant_option.py --ticker TSLA --option-type put --K 200 --T 0.5 --r 0.03 --paths 50000
```

*Sample outputs in this README use AAPL as the ticker.*

### Interactive Notebook

For a more interactive experience, a Jupyter notebook is provided in the `notebooks` directory. The default ticker in the notebook is set to AAPL for consistency with the sample outputs, but you can change it to any valid symbol.

```bash
# Launch the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/QuantOptionDemo.ipynb
```

---

## ✅ Testing and Validation

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implementation.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=quant_option
```

### Validation Framework

- **Analytical Correctness**: The Black-Scholes formulas are tested against known, trusted values to ensure their accuracy.
- **Stochastic Validation**: The Monte Carlo engine's results are validated for convergence to the analytical Black-Scholes price. Reproducibility is ensured by testing with a fixed random seed.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The test suite includes checks for edge cases such as zero volatility and zero time-to-maturity to ensure the models behave as expected.
- **Data Pipeline**: The volatility estimation from historical data is tested using a static dataset for consistency.

### 🗝️ Key Results (AAPL, K=150, T=1.0, r=0.01, 50,000 paths)

| Metric             | Value        |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **BS Price**       | **19.6754**  |
| **MC Price**       | **19.0907**  |
| VaR (5%)           | 19.6754      |
| CVaR (5%)          | 19.6754      |
| **Analytic Δ**     | **0.5757**   |
| **MC Δ**           | **0.5731**   |

**Enhanced Risk Analysis:**
- **Probability of Expiring Worthless**: 55.5%
- **Expected P&L**: -$0.5846
- **P&L Standard Deviation**: $33.6852
- **Maximum Loss**: -$19.6754 (full premium)
- **Maximum Gain**: $462.8489

**VaR/CVaR at Different Confidence Levels:**
- 1%: VaR=$19.6754, CVaR=$19.6754
- 5%: VaR=$19.6754, CVaR=$19.6754
- 10%: VaR=$19.6754, CVaR=$19.6754
- 25%: VaR=$19.6754, CVaR=$19.6754

**⚠️ Note on VaR/CVaR Calculation:**

The VaR and CVaR values equal the BS price because:

1. **At-the-money option**: For S₀=K=150, approximately 55% of Monte Carlo paths result in the option expiring worthless
2. **5th percentile threshold**: Since 55% > 5%, the 5th percentile loss equals the maximum possible loss (the full option premium)
3. **Expected behavior**: This is mathematically correct but not very informative for risk analysis

**For more meaningful VaR/CVaR, consider:**
- Out-of-the-money options (higher probability of expiring worthless)
- Different confidence levels (e.g., 1% instead of 5%)
- P&L from seller's perspective
- Portfolio-level risk metrics

## Performance (NumPy vs Numba)

Fair comparison with shared RNG, JIT warm-up, and separate stage timing.

For small path counts, vectorized NumPy can win (JIT overhead). Beyond ~50–100k paths, the looped numba kernel with prange and fastmath typically pulls ahead.

- Markdown snippet: `benchmarks/README_snippet.md`

# Performance Benchmarks

Monte Carlo option pricing performance comparison.

| Engine | Paths | Seconds |
|---|---:|---:|
| numpy | 10,000 | 0.015 |
| numba | 10,000 | 0.008 |
| numpy | 100,000 | 0.152 |
| numba | 100,000 | 0.041 |
| numpy | 500,000 | 0.755 |
| numba | 500,000 | 0.185 |
| numpy | 1,000,000 | 2.418 |
| numba | 1,000,000 | 0.385 |

## Hedged P&L (Discrete Delta Hedging)

- Black–Scholes GBM dynamics, discrete re-hedging on a configurable grid (e.g., daily/weekly).
- Fee model: proportional (bps on traded notional) + optional fixed per trade.
- Outputs: P&L distribution, percentiles, annualized Sharpe; plots show **tracking error vs. re-hedge frequency** and the **cost–error trade-off**.

**Repro:**
```bash
python scripts/run_hedge.py --S0 100 --K 100 --T 0.5 --r 0.02 --sigma 0.2 \
  --option-type call --n-paths 100000 --rebalance-every 1 --fee-bps 1.0
```

Takeaway: Higher frequency ↓ tracking error, ↑ trading costs. Choose a frequency on the efficient frontier.

## Implied Volatility (BS) + Mini Surface

Robust IV via Brent/bisection with no-arbitrage bounds and round-trip unit tests.

CSV-driven demo: reads `data/iv_demo.csv`, writes `plots/iv_grid.csv` and `plots/iv_surface.png`.

**Repro:**
```bash
python scripts/calibrate_surface.py
```

Sample (moneyness = K/S, maturity in years), extracted from `plots/iv_grid.csv` when present:

| Moneyness \ T | 0.25 | 0.50 |
|---------------|------|------|
| 0.90          | 0.11 | 0.14 |
| 1.00          | 0.21 | 0.23 |
| 1.10          | 0.04 | 0.07 |

*(Numbers are illustrative; see your generated CSV for exact values.)*
