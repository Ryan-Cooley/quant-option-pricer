# Monte Carlo Option Pricer

This project grew out of a curiosity about how complex systems behave under uncertainty and how we can build tools to explore those questions at scale. The Monte Carlo Option Pricer is a fast, reliable simulation engine that models financial options and serves as a testbed for understanding risk, performance, and system robustness in real-world scenarios. By combining modern Python techniques with a focus on reproducibility and automation, it invites scientists, engineers, and curious minds alike to experiment, learn, and trust the results. The project is fully automated and production-ready, designed to run smoothly and transparently in any environment.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Flexible Simulation Engine**: Models complex systems and their behavior under uncertainty, using both analytical and simulation-based approaches.
- **Live Data Integration**: Ingests real-world data to keep experiments grounded and relevant.
- **Risk Modeling & Performance Metrics**: Provides clear insights into system reliability, variability, and sensitivity to changing conditions.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Generates intuitive plots that help users see how systems respond to different scenarios.
- **Reproducibility & Automation**: Automated testing, containerization, and continuous integration ensure results are reliable and easy to share.
- **Data Hygiene**: Uses Adjusted Close prices for log-returns, ensuring accurate volatility estimation and handling of dividends/splits.
- **Robust Greeks**: Delta and Vega functions handle both scalars and arrays, so surface plots are always correct (no NaNs or errors at edges).

## 🏁 Quickstart

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/quant-option-pricer.git
cd quant-option-pricer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Option Pricer

```bash
python quant_option.py --ticker AAPL --S0 150 --K 155
```

### 3. Run the Full Test Suite

This command runs all unit and integration tests to ensure the models are functioning correctly.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

### 4. Run the Performance Benchmark

```bash
python benchmark_performance.py
```

### 5. Run in Docker

For guaranteed reproducibility, build and run the project in a container.

```bash
docker build -t quant-option .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/plots:/app/plots" quant-option
```

## ✅ Testing & Validation

A key feature of this project is its emphasis on correctness and reliability, enforced by a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`.

- **Analytical Correctness**: The Black-Scholes formula and its Greeks are tested against known, trusted values to ensure their implementation is accurate.
- **Stochastic Validation**: The Monte Carlo simulator is tested for:
    - **Reproducibility**: Guarantees that the same random seed produces the exact same pricing result.
    - **Convergence**: Verifies that the MC price converges to the analytical Black-Scholes price within a tight tolerance as the number of simulation paths increases.
- **Data Pipeline Integrity**: The volatility calculation is tested using a static, local data file to ensure the data processing logic is sound and independent of live data sources.
- **Sanity Check Unit Tests**: Includes tests for zero volatility, zero time-to-maturity, and at-the-money edge cases—ensuring mathematical correctness in all scenarios.

This rigorous testing framework ensures that the results produced by the models are not just fast, but also accurate and reliable.
