# Monte Carlo Option Pricer

A high-performance, production-ready Monte Carlo simulation engine for pricing European options, complete with comprehensive risk analysis and visualization. This project showcases a blend of advanced Python programming, financial modeling, and modern software engineering best practices.

## üéØ Overview

The Monte Carlo Option Pricer provides a robust framework for option valuation by combining the analytical Black-Scholes model with stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. The core of the project is a high-performance simulation engine, accelerated with Numba JIT compilation, which achieves a significant speedup (over 100x) compared to pure Python implementations. This allows for large-scale simulations without sacrificing performance.

### Key Capabilities

- **Dual Pricing Models**: European Call and Put option pricing using both the analytical Black-Scholes formula and a Monte Carlo simulation engine.
- **Comprehensive Risk Metrics**: Calculation and visualization of key risk metrics, including Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and the Greeks (Delta and Vega).
- **Live Data Integration**: Seamless integration with Yahoo Finance to fetch historical price data and calculate annualized volatility for more realistic pricing.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: A suite of plotting functions to generate insightful visualizations, including simulation convergence analysis, P&L distributions, and 3D sensitivity surfaces for the Greeks.
- **Production-Ready**: The project is fully containerized with Docker, includes a comprehensive test suite with `pytest`, and features a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and code quality checks.

## üèÅ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` or `conda` for package management.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/quant-option-pricer.git
cd quant-option-pricer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

The primary entry point is `quant_option.py`, a command-line interface for pricing options.

```bash
# Price a call option for any ticker (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, TSLA)
python quant_option.py --ticker MSFT

# Price a put option for TSLA with custom parameters
python quant_option.py --ticker TSLA --option-type put --K 200 --T 0.5 --r 0.03 --paths 50000
```

*Sample outputs in this README use MSFT as the ticker.*

### Interactive Notebook

For a more interactive experience, a Jupyter notebook is provided in the `notebooks` directory. The default ticker in the notebook is set to MSFT for consistency with the sample outputs, but you can change it to any valid symbol.

```bash
# Launch the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/QuantOptionDemo.ipynb
```

## ‚úÖ Testing and Validation

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implementation.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=quant_option
```

### Validation Framework

- **Analytical Correctness**: The Black-Scholes formulas are tested against known, trusted values to ensure their accuracy.
- **Stochastic Validation**: The Monte Carlo engine's results are validated for convergence to the analytical Black-Scholes price. Reproducibility is ensured by testing with a fixed random seed.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The test suite includes checks for edge cases such as zero volatility and zero time-to-maturity to ensure the models behave as expected.
- **Data Pipeline**: The volatility estimation from historical data is tested using a static dataset for consistency.
