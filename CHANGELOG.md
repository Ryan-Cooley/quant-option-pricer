- Updated CI workflow to use new default rebalance frequencies
- Updated README repro commands and flags table to reflect new defaults

### Fixed
- Code quality: Black formatting and Flake8 compliance across all files
- CI artifacts now show proper 4-point frontier plots

- Units toggle for TE/Cost denominators (`--units {s0,premium}`)
- Frontier scatter plot (`plots/hedge_frontier.png`)
- Metadata stamps on plots with simulation parameters
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features

### Changed
